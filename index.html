                Hi I'm Colin
                I'm currently a senior at Roxbury Latin studying Classics, Mathematics, and Science. I
                love to learn random skills and building stuff.
              </p>
              <p class="modal-paragraph-text sm-margin-top">
                In my free time you'll definitely catch me watching shows like The Good Place, 
                Arcane, and Frieren: Beyond Journey's End. Alternatively, I might be speedcubing, 
                memorizing digits of e, drawing, or juggling. However, you are probably most likely 
                to find me watching math videos or reading to relax. Some of my favorite YouTube chanels
                are Michael Penn / Math Major, 3Blue1Brown, The Bright Side of Mathematics, and Dr. Trefor Bazett.

                  I volunteer at my elementary school's garden. Recently I finished painting
                  the benches a bright red and have been working on raking leaves 
                  and putting up Halloween decorations.

                <li class="list-text">
                  I run Cross Country and Track for my school, so you'll find me out for runs down the
                  Esplanade in Boston.
                </li>
                <li class="list-text">
                  Course work can be intense! You'll find me in the quiet
                  rooms studio doing work. I also spend a few hours each week as
                  a lab assistant researching.
